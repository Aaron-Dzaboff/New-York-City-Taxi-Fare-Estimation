# New-York-City-Taxi-Fare-Estimation

Synopsis:

Ryde is a (hypothetical) startup company based in New York City developing a smartphone app
that provides a ride-sharing service in NYC. The current business model of Ryde relies on an
algorithm that estimates a reasonable but compatible amount of fare for an estimated travel
distance. However, Ryde’s algorithm does not consider other important variables that may
determine the overall travel time and the fare amount, such as pick-up and drop-off locations,
time of the day, day of the week, etc. In this regard, Ryde hired you as a chief data scientist to
develop a better prediction model for their next major version update.

Data sources:

You MUST use the data set published by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission
(TLC). The data set can be found in the following URL: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlctrip-record-data.page There are trip records available from 2009 to the current date. 

Use your own discretion to determine how many years worth of data is going to be used for the analysis,
but at least years 2019 and 2020 must be included in the analysis. Please also note that for-hire
vehicles (“FHV”) are beyond the scope of Ryde’s business. In addition to the TLC data, you are
also allowed to use other publicly available data sets as you see fit.

Variables:

The response variable to be predicted is trip fare, represented in dollars. For independent
variables (regressors), in addition to the columns available in the “TLC Trip Record Data,” you
are encouraged to develop some additional features as you see fit.
